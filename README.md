# :sun_with_face: Weather Web App

The weather web app is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to get live weather reports for a selected location. It is designed with a user-friendly interface that enables users to input the city, state, and country of the location they wish to check the weather. The app fetches data from an external weather API and presents it to the user in an organized and easy-to-understand manner.

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript, making it lightweight and fast. It uses the Fetch API to retrieve data from the external weather API. The app's design is optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to check the weather on-the-go.

The app provides a 1-day hourly live weather report, giving users up-to-date information on the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and other weather conditions. Additionally, it offers a 2-day future forecast, enabling users to plan their activities based on the weather conditions for the next two days.

The main purpose of creating the weather web app is to provide a quick and easy way for people to get accurate weather information for their location.
